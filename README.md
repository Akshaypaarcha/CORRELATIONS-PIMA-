# Pima India Analyize
The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset is a collection of information about Pima Indian women and their health. 
It contains data on 768 women and includes eight different measurements, such as the number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI).
The dataset also indicates whether each woman has diabetes or not. The goal of using this dataset is to develop a model that can predict whether a person has diabetes based on their measurements.
